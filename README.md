# :memo: Google Docs Clone

A Google Docs Clone build with React, Socket.io and Mongoose.

## :mag: About

A Google Docs like application build in React.
The server is set up with socket.io allowing several users to work on the same document.
Quill and it's delta value handles the real time changes of the document by different users.
MongoDB and mongoose is being used to store all of that information.

Also includes a dashboard with previews of each document, as well as the ability to continue working on an existing or create a new document.

## :clipboard: Ideas

- titles
- dashboard search function
- document exports


## :wrench: How To Run

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Therefore make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

In the main directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

For more information check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/)!
